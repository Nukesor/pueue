        This is mostly important for crashes, panics and weird daemon behavior.
        Logs helps me to debug a problem, especially if the bug is something that's not clearly visible.

        You can get detailed log output by launching `pueue` or `pueued` with the `-vvv` flag directly after the binary name.

        In case of a panic/crash, please run the program with the `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable set.
        That way we get a proper stack trace.
