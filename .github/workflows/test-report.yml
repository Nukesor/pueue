# This workflow makes it possible to publish test reports without running into
# permission issues when the test workflow was run from a fork or by Dependabot.
#
# The test workflow uploads a junit file per matrix target as an artifact, plus
# the worflow events file, both of which this worfklow buids upon. Note that
# the events file artifact, specifically, is expected to be named 'Event File'.
#
# See the [Publish Test Results action documentation][ptr] for more information.
