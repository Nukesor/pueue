Syntax:
   [column_selection]? [filter]* [order_by]? [limit]?

where:
  - column_selection := `columns=[column]([column],)*`
  - column := `id | status | command | label | path | enqueue_at | dependencies | start | end`
  - filter := `[filter_column] [filter_op] [filter_value]`
    (note: not all columns support all operators, see \"Filter columns\" below.)
  - filter_column := `status | command | label | start | end | enqueue_at`
  - filter_op := `= | != | < | > | %=`
    (`%=` means 'contains', as in the test value is a substring of the column value)
  - order_by := `order_by [column] [order_direction]`
  - order_direction := `asc | desc`
  - limit := `[limit_type]? [limit_count]`
  - limit_type := `first | last`
  - limit_count := a positive integer

Filter columns:
  - `status` supports the operators `=`, `!=`
    against test values that are:
      - strings like `queued`, `stashed`, `paused`, `running`, `success`, `failed`
  - `command`, `label` support the operators `=`, `!=`, `%=`
    against test values that are:
      - strings like `some text`
  - `start`, `end`, `enqueue_at` contain a datetime
    which support the operators `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`
    against test values that are:
      - date like `YYYY-MM-DD`
      - time like `HH:mm:ss` or `HH:mm`
      - datetime like `YYYY-MM-DDHH:mm:ss`
        (note there is currently no separator between the date and the time)

Examples:
  - `status=running`
  - `command%=echo`
  - `label=mytask`
  - `columns=id,status,command status=running start > 2023-05-2112:03:17 order_by command first 5`
